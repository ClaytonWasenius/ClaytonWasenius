ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ClaytonWasenius, currently studying at Penn State University and am in the middle of my junior year. I have a solid understanding of C, C++, Java and am currently studying front end software languages including CSS and JavaScript, as well as learning how to incorpate my understanding of these languages into learning framworks like React and Node.js. 

I have experience in data science especially within the facebook marketing space as I used to run numerous businesses during the ecommerce boom between 2017 - 2019. 

Just finished Conway's Game of Life in 2-dimensions (C++), hoping to advance into 3-dimensions and then onto 4d to discover how different ecosystems could possibly thrive in multiple dimensions along with allowing the user to change Conway's rules to observe the variance how life forms can thrive in different dimensions with/without different rulesets for reproduction and decay. 

As far as collaborations, I'm open to collaboration in anything! Always trying to gain more experience in both spaces of software development, and data science.
