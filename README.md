ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ClaytonWasenius, currently studying at Penn State University and am in the middle of my junior year. I have solid understanding of C, C++, and Java and am currently studying front end software languages including CSS and JavaScript, as well as learning how to incorpate my understanding of these languages into learning framworks like React and Node.js. 

I have experience in data science especially within the facebook marketing space as I used to run numerous businesses during the ecommerce boom between 2017 - 2019. 

As far as collaborations, I'm open to collaboration in anything! Always trying to gain more experience in both spaces of software development, and data science.
